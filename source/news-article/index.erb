        <p>Finally — some good news for the bees of Hawaii.</p>
        <p>
          The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has given endangered status to seven
          species of yellow-faced bees native to the islands. These are “the first
          bees in the country to be protected under the Endangered Species Act,”
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xerces.org/blog/seven-bees-in-hawaii-added-to-us-endangered-species-list/">
          according to the Xerces Society</a>, which advocated for the new designation.

          The new rule designating protections for the bees, published Friday
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-30/pdf/2016-23112.pdf">in the
          Federal Register</a>, states that yellow-faced bees are known “for their
          yellow-to-white facial markings.” They look like small wasps, according to
          the rule, except for their ”plumose [branched] hairs on the body that are
          longest on the sides of the thorax, which readily distinguish them from wasps.”

          The yellow-faced bee is the only bee native to Hawaii, meaning that it was
          able to reach the Hawaiian Islands on its own,
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/uhmg/news/V9-Magnacca-NativeBee.pdf">
          according to a fact sheet</a> provided
          by the University of Hawaii's Master Gardner Program. “From that one original
          colonist they evolved into 63 known endemic species, about 10% of the world's
          yellow-faced bees and more than are found in this genus in all of North America.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But the populations of these seven species are getting smaller and smaller,
          according to Fish and Wildlife. For example, the Hylaeus anthracinus was once
          found in dozens of locations around Hawaii but is now in only 15 — while Hylaeus
          hilaris and Hylaeus kuakea are each found only in one location.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seven endangered species are impacted by a wide variety of threats,
          including habitat destruction because of urbanization or nonnative animals,
          the introduction of nonnative plant species, wildfires, nonnative predators
          and natural events such as hurricanes, tsunamis and drought.
        </p>
        <p>
          The protected status “will allow authorities to implement recovery programs,
          access funding and limit their harm from outside sources,” as Gregory Koob
          of the Fish and Wildlife Service told The Associated Press. He added that
          “all federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service when
          interacting with endangered species.”
        </p>
        <h4 class="highlight">
          The Xerces Society called the new rule “excellent news” but added that
          “there is much work that needs to be done to ensure that Hawaii's bees thrive.”

          “These bees are often found in small patches of habitat hemmed in by agricultural
          land or developments,” the group said.
        </h4>
        <p>
          “Unfortunately, the [Fish and Wildlife Service] has not designated any
          ‘critical habitat’ areas of land of particular importance for the
          endangered bees.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/26/468241649/report-more-pollinators-species-in-jeopardy-threatening-world-food-supply">
          As we've reported</a>, pollinators are under threat around the world. A
          U.N.-sponsored report released in February found that “about 40 percent of
          invertebrate pollinator species (such as bees and butterflies) are facing
          extinction.” This could have major implications for world food supply,
          because “about 75 percent of the world's food crops ... depend at least
          partly on pollination.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the threats, the University of Hawaii says these bees “have managed
          to persist with amazing tenacity.” While this group of species is now endangered,
          new species of the genus are discovered regularly — “11 new native species
          have been found in the past 15 years.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The rule, which goes into effect at the end of the month, also gives the
          endangered designation to 39 plant species found on the islands and to three
          other animals native to Hawaii — the band-rumped storm-petrel, the orangeblack
          Hawaiian damselfly, and the anchialine pool shrimp.
        </p>
        <p>
          The anchialine pool shrimp is known for its unusual longevity —
          <a target="_blank" href="http://hawaiinaturejournal.weebly.com/hawaii-plants-and-animals-in-the-backyard-and-beyond/slipping-through-the-cracks-opae-ula-hawaiian-red-shrimp">
          according to the Hawaii Nature Journal</a>, the shrimp can live for 10 to 15 years in the wild.
