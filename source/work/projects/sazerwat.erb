      My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/skim">Steve Kim</a> keeps a great list of
      his favorite Sazeracs in Chicago. I built a prototype for him to create an app and
      list new sazzy reviews and keep track of the best and worst in town.

      Skim recently moved to London, so I'm sure he's working on a whole new list.
      I'm hoping he actually launches this someday to share the inside scoop with
      other Chicagoans, but either way it was really fun to make.
