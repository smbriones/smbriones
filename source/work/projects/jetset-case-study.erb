    <h5>The Product</h5>
    <p>When we first met with Julia, she shared her frustrations with us about  not having the right
    tool for her business. Her company creates custom luxury trips. The kinds of trips that involve
    anything from scuba diving in the Maldives to East African safaris.</p>
    <h5>The Problem</h5>
    <p>Every moment counts when Julia and her team are planning several trips at once. She wanted to
    reclaim that time they had been spending on parts of the process that could be more automated.
    </p>
    <p>One of the biggest problems that Julia and her team were experiencing was with paper itineraries.
    They were printing itineraries that were pages and pages long so that their clients would have
    access to them wherever they were while travelling the world. There would be a lot of times where
    they wouldn't have internet access, so paper itineraries were the only option.</p>

    <p>The way that Julia's team created these itineraries was another issue. They were putting
    each one together by hand using Microsoft Word. They would paste in images they collected,
    add all the reservation details and ticketing infromation, format the text, print them, and
    finally hand-deliver them to the client.</p>
    <h5>The Solution</h5>
    <p>After meeting with Julia a couple of times, our team came to the conclusion that a combination
    of a web based admin interface for the advisors on Julia's team, with an iOS application which
    stores the itinerary information on the client's device would work well for them. The travellers would
    no longer need to rely on large stacks of paper that they would have to carry around with them, and
    they were already carrying their iPhone or iPad anyway.</p>
    <p>Along with the digital itineraries came the idea and creation of PDF itineraries. If a traveller
    preferred it, they could recieve a printed copy of the itinerary without the advisors needing to do
    a lot of extra work. The itineraries were designed to match the rest of the JetSet branding, and
    since have been designed to use fewer peices of paper.</p>

    <h5>The Process</h5>
    <p>I began designing the admin interface and iOS app in tandum. Julia and I communicated
    multiple times a day. We were even text messaging eachother because she preferred it to email.
    I would text her a screen shot of the itinerary view and she would text back with some feedback
    or a thumbs up. This process allowed me to quickly learn what Julia was looking for.</p>

    <p>Julia and her team wanted a clean and classy interface that would reflect their
    <a href="http://jetsetworldtravel.com">existing luxury brand</a>. She pointed out how much
    she liked the look of brands like <a href="http://www.gilt.com/">Gilt</a> and
    <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a>. Using a darker base for the color palette,
    I was able to create user interfaces that felt timeless and sophisticated, while being unique to
    <a href="http://www.jetsetworldtravel.com/">JetSet World Travel</a>.
