    <h5>The Project</h5>
    <p>
      <a target="_blank" href="http://resthooks.org/">Resthooks.org</a> is an open source initiative from <a target="_blank" href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>
      (started in 2013). REST Hooks are a lightweight subscription layer on top of your existing REST API.

      For my <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.stephaniebriones.com/2016/10/02/october-design-challenge.html">
      October Design Challenge</a> today, I needed to design, (or redesign) a logo. While I
      don't think I have a <em>final</em> version here, it was really interesting, (and
      quite challenging) to see what I could come up with in a short amount of time.
