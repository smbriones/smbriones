      Open Mentor is a side project that I started with my partner in early 2016.
      We're building a place for mentors and those wanting mentorship to connect
      and grow together. OM is fully open source, and if you'd like to help us,
      you can take a look at the list of <a href="https://github.com/OpenMentor/OpenMentor/issues">
      todos on GitHub</a> and see if there's anything you'd like to work on.
    </p>
    <h5>Mentors</h5>
    <p>
      The main page of Open Mentor is a list of all mentors. You can filter mentors
      here by skill, and also by name.</p>

    <h5>Profiles</h5>
    <p>
      The opposite side of a mentor's card contains links to their various social
      media accounts, (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, Dribbble) to learn more about them.</p>

    <h5>Avatars</h5>
    <p>I wanted to make a set of avatars that weren't the generic user silhouette
    that you see in every icon set. I also didn't want to use initials. I wanted
    something that could be part of the design from the start, not an afterthought.

    <p>
      I started with a photo from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> of a
      mountain range with a lot of different shapes, peaks, and plateaus. I cut out
      circles from the image to make unique patterns, and then used color to add more
      variety. This gave us 24 unique avatars to randomly assign new users until
      they upload their own profile image.
